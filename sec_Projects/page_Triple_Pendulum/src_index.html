    Pleas note that this is identical to <a href="https://jakei.github.io/WebGLPendulum/dp.html" target="_blank">
    one of my earlier Projects</a>. The user interface was changed
    slightly und the following description was added though.
  <p>

  <h1>How dose it work?</h1>

    The system of 3 attached pendula can be described using the following <em>constants</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>The <em>lengths</em> j, k, l (all positive real numbers)</li>
      <li>The <em>masses</em> m, n, o (all positive real numbers)</li>
      <li>The <em>gravitational constant</em> g (a positve real number)</li>
    </ul>
    The systems <em>state</em> is best described using a set of three vectors
    (<em>vec alpha, vec betha, vec gamma</em>) each containing the value of the respective
    angle, as well as it's fist, and second derivative.
    (Note: that the systems state has a total of 9 real dimensions)
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many options available for describing mechanical Systems. The most common is Forces.
    It's possible to describe any mechanical system
    using forces, unfortunately it is very hard in case of triple pendulum above to do so.
    In fact it is so hard that it would be totally impractical to do and a more
    sophisticated approach is needed.
    The forces used are often though of as contemporary force fields
    which implies the possibility of formulizing a potential Function (sometimes referred to as Lagrange Function)
    such that its gradient is the force field. Conveniently this potential function
    turns out to be nothing but the sum of all energies in the system hence can be found easily.
    Once the potential function was formally described, the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Lagrange_equation">Euler-Lagrange Equation</a> can be
    used repeatedly (with respect to all variables) to find
    a system of differential equations describing the motion of all pendula.
  </p>
  <p>
    Doing so results in the following system of differential equations.
    (Note that the function J has been introduced as a short hand notation).

    This is a system of 3 non-linear, non-homogeneous, 2nd order ordinary
    differential equations (ODEs) and it can not be solved analytically. In order
    to obtain a numerical solution the order can be reduced by adding 3
    equations describing the fact that the angular velocity of any angle is
    equal to this angles derivative. The resulting system consists of 6 equations each
    a first order ODE and can be solved with some
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods">Runge-Kutta method</a>.
    Any of those methods will do but the above simulation uses Euler's method (1st order Runge-Kutta).
    (Note that Euler's method is less accurate than higher order
    Runge-Kutta methods).
