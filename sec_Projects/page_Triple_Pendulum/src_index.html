    Please note that this is identical to <a href="https://jakei.github.io/WebGLPendulum/dp.html" target="_blank">
    one of my earlier Projects</a>. The user interface was changed
    slightly und the following description was added though.
  <p>

  <h1>How does it work?</h1>

  <p>
    The system of 3 attached pendula can be described using the following <em>constants</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>The <em>lengths</em> j, k, l (all positive real numbers)</li>
      <li>The <em>masses</em> m, n, o (all positive real numbers)</li>
      <li>The <em>gravitational constant</em> g (a positive real number)</li>
    </ul>
    The systems <em>state</em> is best described using a set of three vectors
    (<em>vec alpha, vec beta, vec gamma</em>) each containing the value of the respective
    angle, as well as it's first, and second derivative.
    (Note: that the systems state has a total of 9 real dimensions, but the
    second derivatives of these angles are not critical for the definition of the systems state in a
    mathematical sense. They are still considered to be part of the state because the resulting linked
    differential equations can be described as independent functions of the system state if this
    definition is used).
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many options available for describing mechanical Systems. The most common is Forces.
    It's possible to describe any mechanical system
    using forces, unfortunately it is very hard to do so in the case above.
    In fact it is so hard, it would be totally impractical hence a more
    sophisticated approach is needed.
    It is possible to describe the behavior of such a system in a single
    Lagrange Function.  Once the Lagrange Function was formally described, the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Lagrange_equation">Euler-Lagrange Equation</a> can be
    used (with respect to each variable) to find
    a system of differential equations describing the motion of all pendula.
  </p>
  <p>
    Doing so results in the following system of differential equations.
    (Note that the function J has been introduced as a short hand notation).

  <p>
    This is a system of 3 non-linear, non-homogeneous, 2nd order ordinary
    differential equations (ODEs) and it cannot be solved analytically. In order
    to obtain a numerical solution the order can be reduced by adding 3
    equations describing the fact that the angular velocity of any angle is
    equal to this angles derivative. The resulting system consists of 6 equations each
    a first order ODE and can be solved with some
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods">Runge-Kutta method</a>.
    Any of those methods will do but the above simulation uses Euler's method (1st order Runge-Kutta).
    (Note that Euler's method is less accurate than higher order
    Runge-Kutta methods).
