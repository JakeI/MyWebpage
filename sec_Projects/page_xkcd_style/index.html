  xkcd style Image Transformation
 </h1>
 <p>
  When presenting a visual representation of pretty much anything it is often
      much easier to draw straight lines with precise edges and a very clean look.
      Unfortunately this could signal a kind of confidence in whatever is represented you
      might not actually have. So in some cases it can be beneficial to
      use less precise visuals suggesting some uncertainty. This usually results
      in a style well known from
  <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">
   xkcd.com
  </a>
  where Randall
      Munroe (author of "what if?") presents nerdy topics using a ruff hand drawn look.
      (Notice that there are many precedents for this. For example:
  <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">
   Khan Academy
  </a>
  and
  <a href="http://www.j3l7h.de/">
   J&ouml;rn Loviscach
  </a>
  are both very successful with
      educational content presented in an unusually messy looking visual style)
 </p>
 <img align="right" draggable="true" src="xkcd_plot.svg" width="300px"/>
 <p>
  This has been recognized by various entities, e.g. the python module
  <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">
   matplotlib
  </a>
  (an excellent plotting library)
      comes with a set of rc parameters
      that transform any figures style to imitate xkcd. (Just surround your plot code with a
      "with plt.xkcd():" block and see the results). The Image on the right demonstrates
      this style.
 </p>
 <p>
  I reproduced the effect in OpenGL. My approach was quite simple:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Let an image be represented by a function
   <b>
    I
   </b>
   : R
   <sup>
    2
   </sup>
   &rarr; R
   <sup>
    4
   </sup>
   which maps the x, y coordinates of a pixel to that pixels color (and alpha value).
  </li>
  <li>
   Let the input Image be denoted as
   <b>
    I
   </b>
  </li>
  <li>
   Choose a Displacement Map
   <b>
    D
   </b>
   which is a function R
   <sup>
    2
   </sup>
   &rarr; R
   <sup>
    2
   </sup>
   (a reasonable function to choose will be discussed below)
  </li>
  <li>
   Get the Output Image
   <b>
    O
   </b>
   as the composite function of Displacement Map
   <b>
    D
   </b>
   and Input Image
   <b>
    I
   </b>
   :
   <span style="white-space: nowrap;">
    <b>
     O
    </b>
    (x, y) :=
    <b>
     I
    </b>
    (
    <b>
     D
    </b>
    (x, y))
   </span>
  </li>
 </ul>

  This is quite a simple setup that depends on choosing a good
      Displacement Map
  <b>
   D
  </b>
  . Obviously, the Euclidian Norm of
  <b>
   D
  </b>
  shouldn't exceed some small value,
      otherwise elements of the input image would end up scattered over the entire output image.
      But the direction remains to be decided. I tried drawing randomly from a uniform distribution.
      But such directions look far too messy. Then I tried to give it a more natural look by drawing form a
      normal distribution instead. Still without satisfying results. I tried to slightly de-noise
  <b>
   D
  </b>
  by
      applying a Gaussian filter; unsuccessful. I tried the previous methods again to generate just a few values
      for my function than I interpolated (linear, quadratic, cubic, etc.) between those values to get
  <b>
   D
  </b>
  ;
      this gives really ugly results.
      I tried to de-noise by taking the Fourier Transform convolving
      with parts of itself and applying the Inverse Fourier Transform. The awful result of this last method
      are displayed on the left (the Euclidian Norm of D increases over time).
 </p>
 <p>
  I had thought about and dismissed the idea of using sinusoids because I was confident that sinusoids would
      look far too regular. I had experienced a similar problem when I tried to implement a "under water" shading
      effect in my
  <a href="../page_PyOpenGL_Graphics_Engine/index.html">
   PyOpgenGL Graphics Engine
  </a>
  .
      (
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUkRj4qoT1bsWpE_C8lZYoQ">
   ThinMatrix
  </a>
  experienced similar issues when
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6qqQACUxXI">
   implementing low poly water
  </a>
  for the game equinox).
      But after the drawing form random distributions approach went as described above, I decided to
      have a go at sinusoids anyway and I am actually quite happy with the results.

  The animation on the right, shows the effect of this final harmonic wave like
      transformation. So the Displacement Map
  <b>
   D
  </b>
  used here is
      given (in standard Cartesian Coordinates) by the function:
 </p>
 <center>
  <img src="DisplacementFunc.svg" width="300px"/>
 </center>
 <p>
  Where
  <em>
   &lambda;
  </em>
  is constant (0.2 in the animation on the right, with the x and y coordinates
      reaching from 0 to 1), and
  <em>
   t
  </em>
  is an indicator of the maximum length displacement vectors can have
      (Note that
  <em>
   t
  </em>
  isn't exactly this max value). In the animation
  <em>
   t
  </em>
  increases from
      0 to 5% over time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the final equation the similarities to e.g. a field of
      normal vectors on moving water are quite obvious (a wave at a specific point in time,
      weirdly using the L1 metric rather than L2).
      So the result can be thought of as an approximation of what you would see if the
      input image lay on the floor of a lake and you were looking through the lakes surface
      down to your input image.
 </p>

  Unfortunately, this is far from perfect and
      it certainly isn't what matplotlib does. Here is a list of
      the methods main floors:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   This doesn't work on text. Text looks distorted without the feel this is going for.
        Fortunately, there is an easy fix: Don't transform text, instead add all text to the
        result after it has been transformed.
  </li>
  <li>
   Thick constant width lines in the input end up with an unnatural looking non constant width.
        I would assume, that matplotlib bypasses the problem, by applying the xkcd effect to the lines location
        not it's width, (easy to do if you are working with vector graphics, impossible with my pixel graphics).
  </li>
  <li>
   Anti aliasing is required. (To generate the animation above I created an image 9 times the size
        of the final output and scaled it down to improve the quality. Its not too bad though; this can be done in a single
        GLSL Fragment Shader so the performance loss is insignificant).
  </li>
 </ul>
