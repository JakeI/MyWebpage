    <h1>What I find Interesting (online)</h1>
    <p>
      The amount of information available online can sometimes make it hard to
      separate the sheep from the goats and find truly excellent sources. So
      here is a list of some online resources I consider both helpful and surprisingly
      hard to find:
    </p>
    <h2>Deep Learning</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A">Siraj Raval's YouTube Channel</a>
        is an excellent overview of deep-learning, neural-networks and
        <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://colah.github.io/">Christopher Olah's blog</a> is all about amazing visualizations
        for all kinds of neural-networks and deep learning methods.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://distill.pub/">Distill</a> is a Blog regularly updated by a hand full of people
        and features many computationally intensive inline visualizations for deep learning problems.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>3D Graphics in modern OpenGL</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ThinMatrix">ThinMatrix</a> is an amazing YouTube channel,
        featuring a regular video blog about the development of the videogame Equlinox,
        excellent high quality tutorials on general OpenGL, and Light Weight Java Game Library.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/">Opengl-Tutorial.org</a> is just what it's domain name sounds
        like.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/index.html">Ogldef</a> contains a great sequence of tutorials.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Didactics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        (<em>&#x26A0;</em> predominantly in German) <a href="http://www.j3l7h.de/">J&ouml;rn Loviscach</a> is a professor of Computer Scinece
        and Mathematics. He successfully implemented a teaching method called "flipped classroom" (or "inverted classroom").
        His page contains a searchable list of more than 3000 Khan-style educational videos dealing with almost any
        mathematics or computer science topics commonly covered in a first year at university. His experiences (frequently shared in public talks)
        are a constant source of inspirations to me.
      </li>
      <li>
        (<em>&#x26A0;</em> predominantly in German) <a href="https://cspannagel.wordpress.com/">Christian Spannagel</a> is a professor of
        Commuter Science and practices an unorthodox teaching style similar to "flipped classroom". He regularly blogs about
        any work related topics including his teaching.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Simulation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.myphysicslab.com/">My Physics Lab</a> is a collection of simulations for basic physics problems.
      </li>
    </ul>
