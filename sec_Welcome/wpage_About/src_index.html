    <p>
      I am a student based in Karlsruhe, Germany. This Page is primarily meant to
      show off some Projects I have and will continue to work on in my spare time.

      As of now (5th of April 2017), this page is about 3 hours old, hence there is very little content
      available. But I have great planes. Also check out my <a href="https://github.com/JakeI">
      GitHub account</a> for additional content.
